        An ICAPS'17 Workshop<br/>
        Pittsburgh, USA<br/>
        19-20 June 2017
        </p>

 <p>Robotics is one of the most appealing and natural applicative area for
 
 the Planning and Scheduling (P&amp;S) research activity, however such a
 
 natural interest seems not reflected in an equally important research
 
 production for the Robotics community. In this perspective, the aim of
 
 the PlanRob workshop is t wofold. On the one hand, this workshop would
 
 constitute a fresh impulse for the ICAPS community to develop its
 
 interests and efforts towards this challenging research area. On the
 
 other hand, it aims at attracting representatives from the Robotics
 
 community to discuss their challenges related to planning for
 
 autonomous robots (deliberative, reactive, continuous planning and
 
 execution etc.) as well as their expectations from the P&amp;S community.</p>

<p>
The PlanRob workshop aims at constituting a stable, long-term for um on

relevant topics concerned with the interactions between Robotics and

P&amp;S communities where researchers could discuss about the

opportunities and challenges of P&amp;S when applied to Robotics.
</p>

<p>
Started during ICAPS 2013 in Rome (Italy), followed by a sec ond

edition at ICAPS 2014 in Portsmouth (NH, USA), a third, forth edition

at ICAPS 2015 in Jerusalem (Israel) and ICAPS 2016 in Lon don (UK), the

PlanRob WS series has gathered excellent feedback from the P&amp;S

community which is also con rmed by the organis ation of a speci c

Robotics Track starting from ICAPS 2014 The PlanRob workshop is

proposed in synergy with the ICAPS Robotic track. We are in contact

with the Robotics Track organizers trying to explore di fferent ways to

synchronize with them. T he PlanRob WS aims to maintain a more informal

forum where also more preliminary/visionary works can be discussed

stimulating direct and open interactions.

        <h3>Important Dates</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paper submission deadline:</strong> <em>March 31, 2017</em></li>
            <li>Notification of acceptance: <em>April 20, 2017</em></li>
            <li>Camera-ready paper submissions: <em>TBD</em></li>
            <li><strong>Workshop date:</strong> <em>June 19 or 20, 2017</em></li>
        </ul>

  <h3>Submissions</h3>
<p>
There are two types of submissions: short position statements and

regular papers. Position papers are a maximum of 4 (four) pages.

Regular papers are a maximum of 12 (twelve) pages. Papers should be

submitted via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=planrob2017">PlanRob 2017 EasyChair website</a>.
</p>


<p>All papers should be typeset in the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit17.zip" target="_blank">AAAI style</a>,
 removing the AAAI
 copyright. Accepted papers will be published on the workshop website

 and printed as a hard-copy.
 </p>

<p>The organizers will investigate the availability of journal editors in

order to invite higher qual ity papers from the PlanRob 2017 edition to

a special issue or post-proceedings volume.</p>

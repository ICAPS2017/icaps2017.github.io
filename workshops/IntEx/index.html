      <h1>Workshop on Integrated Planning, Acting, and Execution</h1> 

      <p>

Automated planners are increasingly being integrated into online execution systems.  The integration may, for example, embed a domain-independent temporal planner in a manufacturing system (e.g., the Xerox printer application) or autonomous vehicles.  The integration may resemble something more like a "planning stack" where an automated planner produces an activity or task plan that is further refined before being executed by a reactive controller (e.g., robotics).  Or, the integration may be a domain-specific policy that maps states to actions (e.g., reinforcement learning).  Online learning may or may not be involved, and may include adjusting or augmenting the model, determining when to repair versus replan, learning to switch policies, etc.  A specific focus of these integrations involves online deliberation, bringing to the foreground concerns over how much computational effort planning should invest over time.

      </p>

      <p>

In any of these systems, a planner generates action sequences that are eventually dispatched to an executive, yet taking action in a dynamic world rarely proceeds according to plan.  When planning assumptions are challenged during execution, it raises a number of interesting questions about how the system should respond.  Is the "acting" side of the system responsible for a response or the "planning" side?  Or do the two need to cooperate and how much?  When should the activity planner abandon or preempt the current goals?  Should the task planner repair a plan or replan from scratch?   Should the executive adjust its current policy, switch to a new one, or learn a new policy from more relevant experience? 

      </p>

      <p>

This workshop aims: (1) to provide a forum for discussing the challenges of integrating online planning, acting, and execution, and (2) to assess the potential for holding an integrated execution competition at ICAPS 2018.  Invited topics include:

      </p>

      <ul>

	<li> online planning, acting, and execution

	<li> position papers, benchmarks, or challenge problems for integrated execution 

	<li> improving planning performance from execution experience

	<li> anytime or incremental planning

	<li> discussions of plan dispatching or plan executives

	<li> execution monitoring; comparing replanning, plan repair, regoaling, plan merging

	<li> goal reasoning, preempting goals, regoaling, soft goals, partial satisfaction of goals

	<li> managing open worlds with closed-world planners; model learning from experience

	<li> determining an observation policy; policy switching; incremental policy adjustment

      </ul>

      <h1>Format</h1>

      <p>

	We plan a one day workshop with a focus on discussion.  In contrast to the invited speaker form, we plan to host “opposing views” debates, where two members of the community will be encouraged to debate a topic relevant to the workshop in as creative a way as possible.  Small-group breakouts after the debates will address questions raised by the debate so all participants gain from the experience.

      <h1>Submission details</h1>

      <a name="submission"></a>

      <p>

	We welcome existing publications from other venues that are appropriate for discussion at this workshop.  Please note in the title area if this work is accepted at another venue.  If the work is under review at another venue (e.g., IJCAI-2017) please notify the organizers so we can avoid potential reviewing conflicts.

      </p>

      <p>

	Submissions may be regular papers (up to 8 pages plus references) or short position papers (up to 4 pages plus references). All papers should conform to the AAAI formatting guidelines and style. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three referees. The top 2 papers based on the reviews will be selected for a fast-track submission to the next ICAPS conference. Please observe anonymous submission guidelins in order to be considered for the fast-track submission.

      </p>

      <p>

	At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate workshop-only registration. 

	</p>

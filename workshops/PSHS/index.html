<h3>Topics and Objectives</h3>

<p>
Many applications for social good in general and for healthcare in particular
have seen light in recent years. Many of these applications are based on
techniques from AI, however not many are from Planning and Scheduling.
</p>

<p>
This workshop seeks to facilitate research and discussion of ideas for Planning
and Scheduling in the domain of Healthcare and for other societal applications.
We are looking for societal applications including healthcare but also beyond,
e.g., better social services, better services for the elderly, better safety in
infrastructure.
</p>


<p>
We seek contributions tackling issues unique to these domains, discussing
crucial features that Planning and Scheduling tools need to support in order to
be used in Healthcare and for societal applications in general. Also, we
especially encourage challenge or position papers.
</p>


<h3>Submissions</h3>
Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit17.zip">Author 
Kit</a>) and 
keep them to at most 9 pages including references. Authors considering 
submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference, 
please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS
reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for
the main conference to the workshop.

Submissions should be made through <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pshs2017">EasyChair</a>.

<h3>Deadlines and Dates</h3>

<ul>
<li>Paper submission deadline: March 17th, 2017 (UTC-12 timezone)</li>
<li>Notification: April 14th, 2017</li>
<li>Workshop: June 19 or 20, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every submission will be reviewed by a member of the organizing
committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the
workshop, significance of the contribution, and technical quality. The
review process will be single-blind: the authors' identity will be
known to the reviewers, but not vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed if this do not
interfere with their submission rules. Submissions under double-blind
review in another conference must be anonymous. In particular,
submissions of papers under revision in IJCAI17 must be anonymous.
</p>

<p>
The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we
encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit
the mold of a typical conference paper.
</p>

<p>
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in
order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main
conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate
workshop-only registration.

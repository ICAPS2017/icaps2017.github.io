                  <p>ICAPS 2017, the 26th 
		    International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, will take
		    place in London, UK, June 12-17, 2017. ICAPS 2017 is part of the ICAPS 
		    conference series, the premier forum for exchanging news and research 
		    results on theory and applications of intelligent planning and 
		    scheduling technology.</p>
		  
                  <p>The ICAPS 2017 program 
		    committee invites paper submissions related to automated planning and 
		    scheduling. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms;</li>
                    <li>Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved;</li>
                    <li>Analytic and implemented tools supporting automated planning and scheduling; and</li>
                    <li>Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
		  <h3>Special Tracks:</h3>
                  <p>ICAPS 2017 will continue to host special tracks in the following areas:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Robotics</strong>:
		      Planning, execution, and coordination for individual or teams of 
		      robots, at the level of tasks, behaviors and motions; applications in 
		      autonomous, mixed-initiative, and human-robot interactive systems; 
		      preference for techniques demonstrated on actual robot systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Novel Applications</strong>: Emerging and deployed applications, case studies and lessons learned.</li>
                    <li><strong>ICAPS 2017 will host a new special track in Planning and Learning</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Additionally, the ICAPS 
		    program will include journal presentations, workshops and tutorials, 
		    each having separate submission and notification dates, to be announced 
		    separately.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Author Guidelines</h3>
                  
                  <p>Authors may submit long 
		    papers (8 pages AAAI style plus up to one page of references) or short 
		    papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper 
		    must be indicated at submission time. For more information, see 
		    icaps17.icaps-conference.org.</p>
                  
                  <p>All papers, regardless of 
		    length, will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, 
		    originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are expected to 
		    meet the same high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of 
		    narrower scope, for example by addressing a highly specific issue, or 
		    proposing or evaluating a small, yet important, extension of previous 
		    work or new idea.</p>
                  
                  <p>Authors making multiple 
		    submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique 
		    content. Papers submitted to ICAPS'17 may not be submitted to other 
		    conferences or journals during the ICAPSâ€™17 review period nor may they 
		    be already under review or published in other conferences or journals. 
		    Overlength papers will be rejected without review.</p>
                  
                  <p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>applications and case studies of planning and scheduling techniques</li>
                    <li>uncertainty and stochasticity in planning and scheduling</li>
                    <li>partially observable and unobservable domains</li>
                    <li>conformant, contingent and adversarial planning</li>
                    <li>plan and schedule execution, monitoring and repair</li>
                    <li>continuous planning, on-line and real-time domains</li>
                    <li>plan recognition, plan management and goal reasoning</li>
                    <li>classical planning techniques and analysis</li>
                    <li>continuous state and action spaces</li>

We reserved a block of rooms at the Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh University Place at the reduced conference rate of $142 plus tax. Space is limited and attendees are encouraged to make their reservations early.
It is important to make a reservation by May 21 2017. Reservation requests received after May 21st, 2017 will be accepted on a space available basis, at the best rate available at that time.

<h1>ICAPS 2017 Workshops</h1>
<h2>Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>

<p>The Organizing Committee for the 27th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2017) invites proposals for its workshop program. The workshops are intended to provide a forum to discuss research advances on a selected topic in an informal setting and to promote dissemination and collaboration on new planning and scheduling challenges. </p>

<p> Proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling are welcome. ICAPS is also open to new topics beyond its traditional workshop offerings. For example, we encourage workshops that promote building bridges to other research communities working with similar technologies (e.g.  verification, diagnosis, operations research) or on related application problems (e.g.  robotics or security). </p>

<p> The workshop (and tutorial) programs will comprise several concurrent events held in the two days before the plenary sessions of the conference. Workshop registration is free for ICAPS participants. </p.

<p> As in previous years, ICAPS supports the integration of the workshop and tutorial programs. Workshop organizers are welcome to also submit a tutorial proposal on a related topic. This tutorial would usually be scheduled in the morning of the workshop in the same room. We envisage that a full-day workshop might contain a quarter-day tutorial. </p>

<p> The preferred length for a workshop is one full day, but half-day (or more than one-day) workshops may be accepted if justified. The format of the workshop is open, and may include oral presentations, talks by invited speakers, a poster session, a demo session, and others activities. Workshop chairs are encouraged to take initiatives that
foster interaction and debate within the community. </p>


<h3> Workshop Proposals </h3>

Workshop proposals should be no more than 3 pages and should provide:

<ul>
<li> A description of the workshop topic.

<li> A brief discussion of why the topic is of interest to ICAPS at this
   time, and why the topic is not adequately addressed by other
   meetings or conferences.

<li> If relevant, title and speaker of the tutorial to be attached to the
   workshop. A full tutorial proposal needs to be send to the tutorial
   chairs (for details, see the separate call for tutorial proposals).

<li> A brief description of the proposed workshop length (if other than
   one day) and format. Innovative formats that aim to increase
   opportunities for discussion and interaction are encouraged.

<li> Names and full contact information for the organizing committee,
   plus short descriptions of their relevant expertise. Strong
   proposals include organisers who bring differing perspectives to the
   workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of
   potential participants.

<li> An estimate of the expected number of workshop speakers (including
   invited, presenters, panelists, etc.) and the expected number of
   workshop attendees. Optionally, a list of proposed attendees that
   have indicated potential (non-binding) interest.
</ul>

The organizers of accepted workshop proposals are responsible for:

<ul>
<li> Producing a Call for Participation (CfP) and contributing materials
   for setting up a web page for the workshop by December 21, 2016.
   The web page and the CfP will be linked to the ICAPS 2017 Web site.

<li> Additional publicity, such as distributing the CFP to relevant
   newsgroups and electronic mailing lists (through liaison with the
   ICAPS 2017 publicity chairs) and especially to potential audiences
   outside the ICAPS community.

<li> Organizing the review process for submissions and issuing
   invitations to participate in the workshop.

<li> Formulating the detailed technical program for the workshop and
   making it available to be uploaded on the ICAPS 2017 web site well
   in advance of the conference. A list of accepted papers for the
   workshop should be ready to be placed on the web site by April 21,
   2017.

<li> Assembling a camera-ready copy for the workshop proceedings in close
   interaction with the workshop program chairs. The workshop
   proceedings will be made available on the ICAPS 2017 web site.
</ul>

PDF, to both the Workshop Chairs with subject "Workshop Proposal for

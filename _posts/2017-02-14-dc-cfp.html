<p>
The Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Automated
Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2017) invites Ph.D. students to apply
for the Doctoral Consortium. The aim of the Doctoral Consortium is to
provide a forum for students to discuss their Ph.D.
work-in-progress with other students and senior researchers working
in similar areas, receive advice and mentoring by senior members
of the field regarding careers and research skills, and generally to
accelerate the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community
and nurture the future of the field.
</p>

<p>
The Doctoral Consortium will be a workshop on June 18th, one day prior
to the main conference.  The DC participants will also present posters
during the main ICAPS conference, in a session open to all ICAPS
participants.
</p>

<p>
Students accepted in the Doctoral Consortium are granted free
conference registration and are eligible for partial financial support
and to apply for a special reduced-rate CMU lodging option.

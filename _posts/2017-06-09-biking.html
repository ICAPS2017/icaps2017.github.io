Do you or your travel companion(s) have some free hours, before, during or after the conference this year?  Would you like to see Pittsburgh up close and personal and find out why Travel + Leisure picked us as one of the "best places to travel"?  In conjunction with Bike Pittsburgh (http://bikepittsburgh.com/) we're organizing a custom tour of the city by bike!  This is a great way to see the sights and learn more about Pittsburgh.
</p>

<p>
If you feel confident riding a bike on our beautiful river trails and on the streets in a group, please respond ASAP with your availability so we can organize a group tour.  Cost for a 2-3 hour tour will be between $20 to $30 per person depending on the amount of people we can interest in this event.

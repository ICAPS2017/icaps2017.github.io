<h3> Bus </h3> The <a href="http://www.flypittsburgh.com/">Pittsburgh International Airport</a> is 22 miles from Carnegie Mellon. The Pittsburgh Port Authority runs the convenient <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/apps/pdfs/28X.PDF">28X bus route from the airport</a>. The 28X departs every 30 minutes from the airport, and the fare is $3.75. The route goes through downtown Pittsburgh and the last stop is at CMU, taking about an hour. The last stop is directly across the road from CMU, at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood.

<h3> Shuttle </h3> An alterative to the bus is the SuperShuttle.  One-way fare from the airport to campus ranges from $27.00 to $36.00. For reservations, contact Super Shuttle at 1-800-258-3826.

<h3> Taxi </h3> Taxi service is also available from the airport, and it costs about $50-$60 one way plus tip. There are typically taxi cabs outside of the airport, but if you need to call for a cab, you can call Yellow Cab (412-321-8100).

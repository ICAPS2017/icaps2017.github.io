<h1>ICAPS 2017 Novel Applications Track</h1>
<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Following the success of the Special Track on Novel Applications at previous ICAPS conferences, ICAPS 2017 will host again a Novel Applications Track.</p>

<p>ICAPS 2017, the 26th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, will take place in Pittsburgh, USA, 18-23 June 2017.  ICAPS 2017 is part of the ICAPS conference series, the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on theory and applications of intelligent planning and scheduling technology.</p>

<p>The goal of this special track is to encourage the submission of papers describing all aspects of the development, deployment and evaluation of planning and scheduling systems for real-world problems.  Topics addressed in applications papers may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Description and modelling of novel application domains</li>
  <li>Engineering issues in using P&amp;S techniques</li>
  <li>Integration of multiple P&amp;S techniques, or of P&amp;S techniques with techniques from other areas or disciplines</li>
  <li>User interface design, visualization and explanation for a P&amp;S application</li>
  <li>Experiences in development, deployment and maintenance of P&amp;S applications</li>
  <li>Evaluation, testing, and validation of P&amp;S applications</li>
  <li>Assessment of impact on end users</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to ensure that papers are reviewed fairly, the track has a separate programme committee consisting of individuals with experience working on applications of Planning and Scheduling technology to real world problems.  Papers submitted to this track will be evaluated using different criteria, particularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Significance of the application problem being addressed</li>
  <li>Importance of P&amp;S technology to solution of the problem</li>
  <li>Novelty of the application and technical approach to the application</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the system and its deployment</li>
  <li>Clarity of the descriptions of the application problem, techniques used, and results</li>
  <li>Applicability to real-world problems such as by dataset complexity and actual use in practice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>18 November 2016</strong> - Abstracts (electronic submission) due</li>
  <li><strong>22 November 2016</strong> - Papers (electronic submission, PDF) due</li>
  <li><strong>26 January  2017</strong> - Notification of acceptance</li>
</ul>

<p>The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12.  That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time.</p>


<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>Authors may submit long papers (8 pages AAAI style plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references).  The type of paper must be indicated at submission time.  For more information, see <a href="/cfp">icaps17.icaps-conference.org</a>.</p>

<p>All papers, regardless of length, will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are expected to meet the same high standards set by ICAPS.  Full technical papers are expected to report on a significant applications effort, emerging or deployed, while short papers may report on more limited aspects of a particular application, approach or study.</p>

<p>Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content.  Papers submitted to ICAPS'17 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS'17 review period nor may they be already under review or published in other conferences or journals.  Overlength papers will be rejected without review.</p>

<p>All submissions will be made electronically, through the EasyChair conference system: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2017"/>https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2017</a>.</p>

  <!-- <h3> Deadline extended: 11th of March 2016</h3> -->
  
  <p>The program committee of The 27th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) invites submissions of published journal papers for the Journal Presentation Track, successfully initiated in 2013.</p>
  
  <p>The track is designed to provide a forum to discuss important results related to automated planning and scheduling that appeared recently (from March 2016 onwards) in selective journals, but have not been previously presented either at ICAPS or at a major AI conference.</p>
  
  <p>The goal of this track is two-fold:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>To provide authors an opportunity to present at the conference important results published in journals that might otherwise not be submitted to the conference due to their length and complexity. Papers that differ from traditional ICAPS format and topics are welcome.</li>
    <li>To broaden the program with lines of work at the intersection between planning/scheduling and related fields such as for example constraint programming, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, robotics, computer games, and operations research. Papers that use planning and scheduling in some innovative way (even if they do not advance the planning technology itself) are welcome.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>Paper Presentation</h3>
  
  <p>All accepted journal presentations will be presented orally during the conference - at least one author is expected to register to ICAPS 2017 and to present the paper in person. Complete citations, abstracts and URLs of the original journal papers (if available from the publisher) will be published at ICAPS 2017 web site as a permanent reference.</p>
  
  
  <h3>Submission Requirements</h3>
  
  <p>Journal track submissions must meet the following criteria:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Candidate papers must be published in a journal such as (but not limited to) AIJ, AURO, JAIR, JAAMAS, KER and other relevant, including interdisciplinary, leading Journals from March 2016 until the submission deadline.</li>
    <li>Papers that are in press may be submitted as long as the final camera-ready version is available.</li>
    <li>Extensions of papers that have been previously presented at ICAPS or another major AI conference (such as IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI) cannot be submitted to this track.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>Submission Process</h3>
  
  <p>All submissions will be done via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=journal-track-icaps17">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=journal-track-icaps17</a>). The submission will be in the following format:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>title of the original journal paper (to be published at web);</li>
    <li>complete reference of the original paper (to be published at web);</li>
    <li>URL, where the paper can be downloaded from the publisher (if available) to be published at web;</li>
    <li>abstract of the paper (to be published at web);</li>
    <li>an accompanying letter containing a brief summary of the key results and contributions and explanation why this paper is interesting to ICAPS community (in PDF);</li>
    <li>a copy of the paper with its final camera-ready contents (in PDF).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Submissions will go through an expedited selection process. Selection criteria include significance of the results, relevance to the planning and scheduling community, and contribution to diversification of traditional ICAPS topics.</p>

<h1>ICAPS 2017 Tutorials</h1>
<h2>Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>
</header>

<p>The Organizing Committee for the 27th International Conference on Automated Planning

and Scheduling (ICAPS 2017) invites proposals for its Tutorial Program.Â  Tutorials offer the

attendees first-hand experience with state-of- the-art trends in research and applications by

leading experts. Registration is free for ICAPS participants.</p>

<p> We welcome proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling (P&amp;S), and highly

encourage typically under-represented topics, such as domain modelling techniques and

P&amp;S applications. We especially welcome topics from outside the ICAPS community that

merge P&amp;S with other areas such as robotics, autonomous agents, and knowledge

representation. Tutorials may include either introductory or advanced topics, providing

either breadth or depth into into P&amp;S.</p>

<p>We expect majority of tutorials to be half-day but quarter-day (90 minutes) tutorials are also

possible.</p.

<h3> Tutorial Proposals </h3>
<p> Tutorial Submissions should include the title, type (advanced or introductory), summary,

outline, and expected length (quarter or half-day) of the tutorial, as well as a short CV of the

proposer(s), including a list of significant publications and/or prior teaching experience

(given tutorials etc.).</p>


<h3> Submission Procedure </h3>

<p>Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, in PDF, to both the Tutorial Chairs with

subject "Tutorial Proposal for ICAPS-17" no later than February 1, 2017. Organizers of

tutorials will be notified by email of the acceptance or rejection of their proposal by

February 20, 2017.</p>

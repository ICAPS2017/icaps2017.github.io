<h1>ICAPS 2017 Robotics Track</h1>
<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>ICAPS will run a Robotics track as part of the main conference, following

the successes of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 edition. The Robotics track

will emphasize the opportunities that emerge from integrating the fields

of AI planning and autonomous robotics. The ICAPS-2017 Robotics track

provides an opportunity for the AI planning and scheduling community to

respond to the challenges that robotics applications pose, and to

contribute to the advancement of intelligent robotics. This is also an

opportunity for the robotics community to propose integrated solutions,

discuss challenges related to planning for autonomous robots

(deliberative, reactive, continuous planning and execution, etc.), and to

showcase the use of planning and scheduling technology in robotics

applications.</p>

<p>The robotics track welcomes work on task, motion, and manipulation

planning, plan execution, execution monitoring and failure recovery,

task-level coordination of robots, and planning for perception.

Submission of work that has been demonstrated on actual robot systems is

specifically encouraged. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robot motion, manipulation, path, task, and mission planning;

combined task and motion planning;</li>
<li>Representation, acquisition and learning of planning models for

robotics;</li>
<li>Failure detection and recovery;</li>
<li>Planning with uncertainty for reliable robots;</li>
<li>Integrated planning and execution in robotic architectures;</li>
<li>Multi-robot planning, scheduling/coordination, and execution;</li>
<li>Planning for long-term autonomy in robotics;</li>
<li>Mixed-initiative planning and variable/[adjustable] autonomy for
robotic systems;</li>
<li>Human-aware planning and execution in human-robot interaction,

including safety;</li>
<li>Planning for cognitive robotics;</li>
<li>Adversarial action planning in competitive robotic domains;</li>
<li>Planning for perception;</li>
<li>Formal methods for robot planning and control;</li>
<li>Benchmark planning domains for robots;</li>
<li>Real-world planning applications for autonomous robots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Author Guidelines</h3>
<p>Authors may submit long papers (8 pages plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated at submission time.
For more information, see the <a href="/cfp">ICAPS 2017 submission page</a>.</p>

<p>Both long and short papers will be reviewed against the standard criteria

of relevance, originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are

expected to meet the high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of

narrower scope, for example by addressing a highly specific issue, or

proposing or evaluating a small, yet important, extension of previous

work or new idea.</p>

<p>Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has

significant unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2017 may not be

submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2017 review

period, nor may they be already under review or published in other

conferences or journals. Over-length papers will be rejected without

review.</p>

<p>All submissions will be made electronically, through the EasyChair conference system: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2017"/>https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2017</a>. Submissions must be in the AAAI format. For more information, see the submission instructions on <a href="/cfp">ICAPS 2017 submission page</a>.
Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the AAAI author kit instructions for formatting: <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a></p>

The proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. All accepted papers will

be published in the main conference proceedings and will be presented

orally at the conference (full papers will be allocated more time).
